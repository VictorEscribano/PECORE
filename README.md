# PECORE ü§ñ
This repository contains the code, assignments, and projects related to the Master's course on Perception and Cognition in Robotic Exploration (Percepci√≥ i Cognici√≥ en l'Exploraci√≥ Rob√≤tica - PECORE) offered at UPC-ETSEIB. The course explores the fundamental concepts, algorithms, and methodologies in robot perception, cognition, and exploration. The repository aims to serve as a resource for students, educators, and practitioners in the field of robotics and autonomous systems. It includes implementations and solutions developed in ROS 2 and other relevant frameworks and tools, covering a range of topics such as sensor processing, mapping, localization, planning, and decision-making in robotic systems.

## Exercise 1: Simple Position Control Loop

In this exercise, we are required to close a simple position control loop by sending velocity commands to the robot. The steps involved are as follows:

1. **Service Client Creation**:
   - Inside the `pubvel` node, create a service client to obtain the "ground-truth" pose of the robot.
   - Subscribe to the `/gazebo/get_entity_state` service.
   - In the service call, use "jackal" as the entity name and "world" as the reference frame.

2. **Desired Position**:
   - Set a hardcoded desired position for the robot in the world frame.
   - Compute the error vector between the current and desired positions.

3. **Velocity Vector**:
   - Normalize the error vector to obtain a unit vector, which will be used as a directional velocity vector.

4. **Velocity Command**:
   - Convert the unit vector to linear `x` and angular `z` velocity values.
   - Publish these values using the velocity publisher built in the previous exercise.

5. **Verification**:
   - Verify the functionality of the simple controller by observing the robot's behavior in reaching the desired position.
